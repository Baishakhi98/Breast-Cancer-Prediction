# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

I have developed an advanced project for breast cancer detection that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence. This system is designed to accurately classify breast tumors as benign or malignant, improving early diagnosis and treatment planning. Utilizing a robust dataset and sophisticated algorithms, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for healthcare professionals to enhance patient outcomes.
